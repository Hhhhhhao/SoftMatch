Official repo for "SoftMatch: Addressing the Quantity-Quality Trade-off in Semi-Supervised Learning", accepted by ICLR 2023. [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10921)[[Open Review]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ymt1zQXBDiF&referrer=%5BAuthor%20Console%5D(%2Fgroup%3Fid%3DICLR.cc%2F2023%2FConference%2FAuthors%23your-submissions))


# Code and Results

We publish our code in both [USB](https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning) and [TorchSSL](https://github.com/TorchSSL/TorchSSL). All Results and training logs are also included. This repo only serves as a re-direction and provides more explanation for the results reported in paper.

Note that, the experiments and results of Table 1 was conducted using TorchSSL since back then USB has not supported classic setting yet. Other results are from USB. 

USB indeed well support classic setting now and SoftMatch has similar performance in USB classic setting.
